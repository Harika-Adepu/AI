Assignment 1  
The Rabbit Leap Problem

Three east-bound rabbits stand in a line blocked by three-west bound rabbits.  
They are crossing a stream with stones places in the east west direction in a line. 
There is one empty stone between them.  
The rabbits can only move forward one step or two steps. 
The solution is implemented using both BFS and DFS approaches.

Assignment 2 
Bridge-crossing over the river within one hour to catch the train

It is raining and Amogh, Ameya and their grandparents have only one umbrella which can be shared by two people.
Amogh can cross the bridge in 5 minutes, Ameya in 10, their grandmother in 20 and their grandfather in 25.
The code finds valid sequences using BFS and DFS to ensure everyone crosses safely within the time limit.
